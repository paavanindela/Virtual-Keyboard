# OpenCV (source: [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdLM6AOd2vc&list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7D1O6skqDQ-JZ1GGHKK-K) )
* Image processing library
* Works with C++,C,python
* Here,we are using python for OpenCV<br>
1. Digital images are stored in matrix [PPI =Pixel Per Inch].<br>
2. Digital images are 2-D arrays of pixels.<br>
### NumPy-->
* Highly optimized library for numeriacl operations.
* All OpenCV array structures are converted to-and-from NumPy arrays.
* More convineient indexing system rather than using for loops.
