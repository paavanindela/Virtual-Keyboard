## Basics of Images and Numpy (Video 1)
* Digital Images are 2D arrays of pixels
* ppi -> Pixels per Inch
### Numpy
```
    import numpy as np
```
* Numpy is highly optimized library for numerical operations
* All the opencv array structures are converted to and from numpy arrays
## Environment Installation in any OS ( Video 2)
* Refer video for installing opencv in OS
## Functions to read and write images (Video 3)
* Install opencv-python package in pycharm
* refer github.com/opencv for sample data ( openCV masters -> sample -> data )
``` 
    import cv2
    cv2.imread('lena.jpg', 1)
    cv2.imread('lena.jpg', 0)
    cv2.imread('lena.jpg', -1)
```
* Here, the second argument in imread() is a flag. flag indicates the way the image should be read.
![types of flags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranayvarmas/Virtual-Keyboard/master/Pranay/OpenCV/pics/sn1.PNG)
* If the image does not exists, the code does not shows any error but the code shows the result "None" in the output
* if zero is given as argument for waitKey() then the windows does not closes untill we close

## Functions to read and write videos from camera (Video 4)
![sn3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranayvarmas/Virtual-Keyboard/master/Pranay/OpenCV/pics/sn3.PNG)
* argument in videocapture() is the index of camera or the name of the video
* fourcc is the format of video 
* 20.0 is number of frames per sec
* cap.isOpened() returns true or false 
* ret has boolean expression (true or false)
* refer docs,opencv.org for flags on videos
## Drawing Geometric Shapes on Images (Video 5)
![sn4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranayvarmas/Virtual-Keyboard/master/Pranay/OpenCV/pics/sn4.PNG)
* np.zeroes function creates an image
* 512,512 are height and width. 3 is no. of channels. It can be 1. np.uint8 is datatype. 
* images can be filled with some color by the function fill()
* Ex : img.fill(255) fills the whole image with white color
* If the thickness argument is given as -1 then it fills the whole shape with the given color
## Setting Camera Parameters (Video 6)
* Camera Parameters can be adjusted by the function cap.set(a,b). a is the flag name or its associated number. b is the value which we are willing for the flag a
```
    cap.set(3,720)
    cap.set(4,720)
```
* 3 and 4 are associated with width and height parameters
* The values adjust to their convenient values close to the given value whatever might be the values given
## Show Date and Time on Videos (Video 7)
```
    import datetime
    
    datet = str(datetime.datetime.now())
    frame= cv2.putText(frame,datet,......)
```
* 3rd line in the code is important
## Handling Mouse Events (Video 8)
![sn5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranayvarmas/Virtual-Keyboard/master/Pranay/OpenCV/pics/sn5.PNG)
* Remember to have3 the same window name "image" in all functions. Otherwise, the output may be different
* img[y,x,0] gives the value of blue channel. similarly, 1 for green and 2 for red. (BGR format)
* for click_event function, the event will be given from the setMouseCallback() function
* Observe the first most line in code 
```
    events=[i for i in dir(cv2) if 'EVENT' in i)
```
* Here, the dir(cv2) is inbuilt function which gives the classes and all member functions in cv2 library
## More Into Mouse Handling (Video 9)
![sn6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranayvarmas/Virtual-Keyboard/master/Pranay/OpenCV/pics/sn6.PNG)
* Extension from prev video
![sn7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranayvarmas/Virtual-Keyboard/master/Pranay/OpenCV/pics/sn7.PNG)
```
    img = np.zeroes((512,512,3), np.uint8)
    img[:]=[b,g,r]
```
* above gives the window of color BGR=(b,g,r) 
## split, merge, resize, add, addWeighted functions in cv2 (Video 10)
![sn8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranayvarmas/Virtual-Keyboard/master/Pranay/OpenCV/pics/sn8.PNG)
* img.dtype gives the data type of the image
* img.shape returns the tuple of no. of rows, columns and channels in the img
* img.size returns the total no.  of pixels in the img
* cv2.split(img) splits the imgae pixels into b,g,r
* merge merges the three
```
    ball = img[280:340, 330:390] //copies the rectangular part into the variable ball
    img[273:333, 100:160]= ball  //replaces the existing pixels with the ball pixels in the original image
```
* Resize of two images to the same size is required to add the images
## Bitwise Operations (Video 11)
!(sn9)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranayvarmas/Virtual-Keyboard/master/Pranay/OpenCV/pics/sn9.PNG]
* Just observe the syntax i the code baove for bitwise operational functions
## Binding Trackbar (Video 12)
![sn10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranayvarmas/Virtual-Keyboard/master/Pranay/OpenCV/pics/sn10.PNG)
![sn11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranayvarmas/Virtual-Keyboard/master/Pranay/OpenCV/pics/sn11.PNG)
* Second image is important
## Object Detection and Object Tracking using HSV

* cv.imread('...') should be in while loop
