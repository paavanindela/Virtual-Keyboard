## Basics of Images and Numpy (Video 1)
* Digital Images are 2D arrays of pixels
* ppi -> Pixels per Inch
### Numpy
```
    import numpy as np
```
* Numpy is highly optimized library for numerical operations
* All the opencv array structures are converted to and from numpy arrays
## Environment Installation in any OS ( Video 2)
* Refer video for installing opencv in OS
## Functions to read and write images (Video 3)
* Install opencv-python package in pycharm
* refer github.com/opencv for sample data ( openCV masters -> sample -> data )
``` 
    import cv2
    cv2.imread('lena.jpg', 1)
    cv2.imread('lena.jpg', 0)
    cv2.imread('lena.jpg', -1)
```
* Here, the second argument in imread() is a flag. flag indicates the way the image should be read.
![types of flags](sn1.png)
* If the image does not exists, the code does not shows any error but the code shows the result "None" in the output
* if zero is given as argument for waitKey() then the windows does not closes untill we close

## Functions to read and write videos from camera (Video 4)
![sn3](sn3.png)
* argument in videocapture() is the index of camera or the name of the video
* fourcc is the format of video 
* 20.0 is number of frames per sec
* cap.isOpened() returns true or false 
* ret has boolean expression (true or false)
* refer docs,opencv.org for flags on videos
## Drawing Geometric Shapes on Images (Video 5)
![sn4](sn4.png)
* np.zeroes function creates an image
* 512,512 are height and width. 3 is no. of channels. It can be 1. np.uint8 is datatype. 
* images can be filled with some color by the function fill()
* Ex : img.fill(255) fills the whole image with white color
* If the thickness argument is given as -1 then it fills the whole shape with the given color
## Setting Camera Parameters (Video 6)
* Camera Parameters can be adjusted by the function cap.set(a,b). a is the flag name or its associated number. b is the value which we are willing for the flag a
```
    cap.set(3,720)
    cap.set(4,720)
```
* 3 and 4 are associated with width and height parameters
* The values adjust to their convenient values close to the given value whatever might be the values given
## Show Date and Time on Videos (Video 7)
```
    import datetime
    
    datet = str(datetime.datetime.now())
    frame= cv2.putText(frame,datet,......)
```
* 3rd line in the code is important
## Handling Mouse Events (Video 8)
